        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                Built 7+ games. Led teams. Survived broken ones.
                Published solo projects, won awards, rewrote legacy code... and then I turned 16.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as game development became a deeper obsession with systems: how things work, how they fail, and how to make
                them better. I've focused on building complex weapon systems, AI behaviors, and gameplay mechanics that feel alive — and
                I'm now pivoting into backend development and automation, chasing stability, scale, and the elegance of clean
                infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve worked solo and in teams. I've dealt with deadlines, disasters, and the strange silence of code that should work but doesn’t. I know what it's like to carry a project when no one else will. I know how to build momentum from zero. And I know how to ship.
                <br>
                I'm not here to follow a script — I’m here to solve problems. To learn fast. To adapt faster. To build things that matter.
                <br><br>
                I don’t have all the answers.
                But I know how to find them.
            </p>

It was a major milestone, marking my first game, first team collaboration, and first time sharing a project with others. The game is a fast-paced action experience set in a continuous boss battle arena, where players need to master timing, pattern recognition, and strategy to survive.

The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging "meatballs" and destroying enemies to earn XP and level up. With tight controls, players use the mouse to aim and dash with left-click to avoid threats. I designed and implemented core mechanics, including movement, dashing, enemy behavior, and XP progression. The tight time constraint pushed my skills in programming, rapid prototyping, and collaborative development with a remote team, ensuring a polished final product." data-cta="Play" data-link="https://shotgunflamez.itch.io/space-crazy" data-devlog="">

I reimagined and expanded it into a complete arcade experience, adding a dynamic spawn system that scales with screen resolution, randomized crate behaviors (including bombs and mystery crates), responsive visual and audio feedback, and a full suite of UI features; from difficulty modes to an FPS counter and settings menu. Through this process, I learned how to extend prefab projects into something custom and meaningful, design scalable systems, and balance gameplay for both challenge and accessibility.
