description: Crate Smasher started as a simple tap game assignment from the Unity Junior Developer course, but I saw it as an opportunity to push beyond the basics. I reimagined and expanded it into a complete arcade experience, adding a dynamic spawn system that scales with screen resolution, randomized crate behaviors (including bombs and mystery crates), responsive visual and audio feedback, and a full suite of UI features; from difficulty modes to an FPS counter and settings menu. Through this process, I learned how to extend prefab projects into something custom and meaningful, design scalable systems, and balance gameplay for both challenge and accessibility. While it may not be my most ambitious game, Crate Smasher reflects my ability to take a foundation and thoughtfully evolve it into something polished, engaging, and complete.
