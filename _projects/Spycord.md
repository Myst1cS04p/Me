description: I created SpyCord, my first-ever Minecraft plugin, to improve server management by providing better visibility into OP and console activity without relying on complex solutions. This lightweight, custom-built plugin logs sensitive actions and sends them directly to a Discord channel via webhooks; no bot setup needed. It tracks OP/console commands (except sensitive ones like /login), detects gamemode changes, and writes activity to both Discord and a local backup file. To use it, simply add your Discord webhook to the config.yml, drop the JAR into your plugins folder, and start the server!
