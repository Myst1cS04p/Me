description: Developed a fully custom Minecraft plugin to implement a dynamic “Strength” system for a Minecraft SMP. The plugin introduces a player-driven progression mechanic where killing opponents increases the winner’s strength level while decreasing the loser’s, creating a competitive gameplay loop. The project was built to replace a broken third-party plugin that allowed critical exploits (e.g., strength duplication). To restore fairness, I rewrote the core logic from scratch, optimized event handling, and implemented secure server-side validation to prevent data tampering.
