description: BOSS FIGHT! was my debut game project, created for the Dev Pad Game Jam. It was a major milestone, marking my first game, first team collaboration, and first time sharing a project with others. The game is a fast-paced action experience set in a continuous boss battle arena, where players need to master timing, pattern recognition, and strategy to survive. The concept was inspired by the jam’s theme, emphasizing the intensity and learning curve typical of boss fights. I built it using GDevelop
