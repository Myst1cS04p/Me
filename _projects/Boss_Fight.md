date: 10th May 2021
description: BOSS FIGHT! was my debut game project, created for the Dev Pad Game Jam. It was a major milestone, marking my first game, first team collaboration, and first time sharing a project with others. The game is a fast-paced action experience set in a continuous boss battle arena, where players need to master timing, pattern recognition, and strategy to survive. The concept was inspired by the jamâ€™s theme, emphasizing the intensity and learning curve typical of boss fights.
