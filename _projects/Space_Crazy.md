description: I created Space Crazy, a fast-paced arcade game for the Boundless Game Jam, where players control Joe Bushyfist, an astronaut stranded in space with a malfunctioning gravity generator. The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging "meatballs" and destroying enemies to earn XP and level up. With tight controls, players use the mouse to aim and dash with left-click to avoid threats. I designed and implemented core mechanics, including movement, dashing, enemy behavior, and XP progression. The tight time constraint pushed my skills in programming, rapid prototyping, and collaborative development with a remote team, ensuring a polished final product.
