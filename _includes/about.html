            <p>
                I'm Myst1cS04p — developer, systems thinker, and prototype alchemist.
                I thrive in chaos and love bending tech into weird, beautiful shapes.
                My work blends logic with aesthetics, and I'm always in pursuit of
                building tools, systems, and digital expressions that punch above their weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it’s code, hardware, or pure idea-space, I live for the rapid fire loop of
                create–test–break–rebuild. If something doesn’t exist yet, I prototype it. And if
                it does exist, I probably mod it.
