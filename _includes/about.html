            <p>
                Built 7+ games. Led teams. Survived broken ones.
                Published solo projects, won awards, rewrote legacy code... and then I turned 16.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as game development became a deeper obsession with systems: how things work, how they fail, and how to make
                them better. I've focused on building complex weapon systems, AI behaviors, and gameplay mechanics that feel alive — and
                I'm now pivoting into backend development and automation, chasing stability, scale, and the elegance of clean
                infrastructure.

            <p>
                I’ve worked solo and in teams. I've dealt with deadlines, disasters, and the strange silence of code that should work but doesn’t. I know what it's like to carry a project when no one else will. I know how to build momentum from zero. And I know how to ship.
                <br>
                I'm not here to follow a script — I’m here to solve problems. To learn fast. To adapt faster. To build things that matter.
                <br><br>
                I don’t have all the answers.
                But I know how to find them.
