                Most people see a game, a paper, or a piece of infrastructure. I see the invisible architecture holding them up—and the cracks where they’ll eventually break.
                <br>
                By the time I was 16, I had already traded the traditional classroom for a more aggressive loop: build, ship, break, repeat. What started as developing games—handling everything from AI behaviors to legacy rewrites—matured into an obsession with the mechanics of the world itself. Whether I’m architecting backend stability or mapping the logical flows of analytical philosophy, the goal is the same: finding the elegance in the complex.
                <br>
                Currently, my focus has shifted from the machine to the mind. I’m spending my time drafting papers on the systems of gaming disorder and human behavior—not as separate interests, but as new environments to debug. I don't follow a script; I look for the underlying logic that makes the script work.
                <br>
                I’m here to build systems that matter, to solve the problems others haven't noticed yet, and to maintain momentum when the silence of a "perfect" system gets too loud.
                <br>
                I don’t have all the answers. 
                But I know how to find them.
