        I've never been very good at following the standard script. It's probably why I cleared high school in a year and spent 9th-grade brokering TF2 items and studying market economics instead of sitting in a classroom. I realized pretty early on that I wasn't that interested in how a project looks on the surface; I cared about the plumbing.

        My background is in building. I've developed 7+ games, but I eventually found I was more of a tool-builder than a designer. I gravitated toward the technical guts: complex weapon systems, AI behaviors, and utility plugins for Minecraft communities. Whether I was writing encryption tools or losing three days to a bugged cPanel host that wouldn't launch my server file, the goal was always stability. I just like building the infrastructure that makes everything else work better.

        That same mindset is what led me into research. I'm currently focused on a paper that reframes gaming disorder as a systems problem, organizing developmental and contextual variables into a model that's more logical and less reactive. To me, this isn't a pivot away from development; it's just a new environment to debug. I'm just looking for the patterns that others might miss while they're looking at the surface.

        I don't have all the answers. <br>
        But I know how to find them.
